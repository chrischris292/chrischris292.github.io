    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>    
            Utilizing a variety of libraries including sentiment, fast-csv, jquery,spellchecker,express, and moment, I analyzed 15MB of text messages over a 2 year span. For privacy, I have just saved the cached results instead of the entire log. I had many issues using node.js with such a large data set and had to carefully watch my memory usage throughout the process.

    <h1>How do I communicate in group chat? </h1>
    <line class = "other"></line>
    <p>    
        This visualization represents the group chat relationships between the four members. I counted the amount of occurances of each member's name to compare who's name is mentioned the most and the relationships among each member. Orange Represents Wilbert, black represents David, yellow represents Linsen, brown represents Chris.
